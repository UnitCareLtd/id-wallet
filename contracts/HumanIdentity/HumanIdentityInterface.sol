/**
* @title HumanIdentityInterface
* @author UnitCare Corporation Ltd. (info@unitcare.co)
* @notice The Human Identity Interface (HII) is a smart contract interface that defines the standard by which
* Kairos and other biometric identity verification providers interact with contracts that implement it.
* 
* The goal is to provide the blockchain community with an open source, decentralized standard for any
* physical identity provider to implement, and a suite of example implementations of this standard for
* both identity providers and identity verifying clients (such as a wallet for a token that associates
* identity to a transaction using the HII).
* 
* The HII is an interface (similar to ERC-20) that, when implemented by a smart contract, allows
* identity providers to interact with said smart contract programmatically and autonomously. The
* initial implementation of this standard interface targets the Ethereum blockchain, but could be
* applied in other decentralized systems in the future.
